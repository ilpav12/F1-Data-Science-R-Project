## What was analyazed
I analized how important is to win in order to get a F1 title, how important is starting in front of the grid to be on the top step of the podium and how different are those percentages in Monaco, which is a classic street circuit that usually do not offer many overtakes. All this with 6 plots and some fun facts.
